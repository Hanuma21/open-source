i am from andhra pradesh,  i started loving coding after joining this college,
even though i have chosen the domain of electrical engineering,so i am looking to lean towards learning
as i have started learning about htis open source i got to know its real importance and i think it is a platform where we really are gonna learn communication among over co devolopers and and learn about how to improvise some damn basic code into a code of such a high and modern or to a required level of its purpose, so as i got know the importance of this open source as i chose it as a module to work on i surely want to explore it to such a depth and become modern age developer who really cares on looking in improvising an project  he is gonna work on..
